<a href="https://radiant-citadel-58253.herokuapp.com/">Check out the live app!</a>

## Description

This is an employee directory web application using React. The app's UI is broken down into components, managing component state, and responding to user events.

"As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information."
<br>
An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.
